In this Big Data Characteristics Analysis, we explore a large-scale medical dataset to uncover insights into health conditions, disabilities, lifestyle factors, medical tests, and physical measurements. Using interactive visualizations, we analyze the prevalence of chronic diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, and diabetes, while also examining risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Additionally, we investigate the impact of vaccinations and medical tests, shedding light on preventive healthcare trends.

This analysis leverages Big Data principlesâ€”Volume, Variety, and Veracityâ€”to ensure a comprehensive and accurate representation of patient health. Through intuitive charts, graphs, and structured insights, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making in the field of public health and medical research.
